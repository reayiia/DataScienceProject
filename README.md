# NFL Player Salary and Performance Analysis (2017)

This repository contains the full deliverables for a data science project analyzing the relationship between NFL player performance metrics and their salary cap impact. The project was completed as part of the COMP3125 Data Science Fundamentals course.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore whether NFL player salaries can be predicted based on their performance statistics using a regression model. A simulated dataset was used due to limited access to real-world advanced NFL metrics.

### üîç Key Objectives:
- Combine salary and performance data into a single dataset
- Simulate player statistics based on position logic
- Apply a multiple linear regression model
- Evaluate model performance using R¬≤, MAE, and RMSE
- Analyze which metrics are most influential in predicting salary
